      The farm-to-table supply chain is deeply affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Restaurants are hurting and so are many of the country's finest farmers that supply them. 

      Farmlist is an online resource connecting the consumers to ranchers, fishermen, vegetable, dairy, and poultry farmers in the U.S. These farmers are now selling direct to consumer, whether it's through a CSA or a webstore, in some cases for the first time.

      Our goal is to highlight these amazing purveyors and connect them with passionate people who want access to their products.

      If you're a farmer or supplier and would like to be added to our list, please fill out this form [add link] and we'll add you to Farmlist.
